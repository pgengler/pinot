  pinot - an developer-focused fork of the GNU nano text editor.

Overview

     The pinot project was started to make some not-insigificant changes
     to the wonderful GNU nano text editor.

     Most of the changes are aimed at making a more developer-friendly
     editor.

How to compile and install pinot

     Download the pinot source code, then:
     tar zxvf pinot-x.y.z.tar.gz
     cd pinot-x.y.z
     ./configure
     make
     make install

     It's that simple.  Use --prefix with configure to override the
     default installation directory of /usr/local.
     
     If you configured with the "--enable-pinotrc" option, after
     installation you might copy the doc/pinotrc.sample to your home
     directory, rename it to ".pinotrc", and then edit it according to
     your taste.

Bug Reports

  For general bug reports, you can use the "Issues" section of the pinot
  Github project: https://github.com/pgengler/pinot/issues

Current Status

  While pinot is new, it is based on GNU nano's 2.3.1 (development)
  release. This means that while there's a good change that things
  will work well, there's always the possibility of something being
  broken. All bug reports are welcome, no matter how insignificant.
