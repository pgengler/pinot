pinot - an developer-focused fork of the GNU nano text editor.

## Overview

 The pinot project was started to make some not-insigificant changes to the
 wonderful GNU nano text editor.

 Most of the changes are aimed at making a more developer-friendly editor.

## How to compile and install pinot (from Github)

```
git clone https://github.com/pgengler/pinot.git
cd pinot
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

## Building from a release

```
tar zxvf pinot-x.y.z.tar.gz
cd pinot-x.y.z
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

## Bug Reports

For general bug reports, you can use the "Issues" section of the pinot
Github project: https://github.com/pgengler/pinot/issues

## Current Status

While pinot is new, it is based on GNU nano's 2.3.1 (development)
release. This means that while there's a good change that things
will work well, there's always the possibility of something being
broken. All bug reports are welcome, no matter how insignificant.

## Building on MacOS
In order to get `pinot` to build on MacOS (using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/)), you'll need to run `brew install gettext` and then `brew link gettext --force` in order to install and use GNU gettext.
